# Contributing

üëçüéâ If you‚Äôre here to contribute to this project: thanks for taking the time! üéâüëç

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to this project.
The goal of this guide is to ensure making contributions goes smoothly. If you have trouble with this process, please help us to improve it by proposing changes.


## Bug reports

If you find a bug or a documentation issue, please [report it](https://github.com/sagikazarmark/helm-charts/issues/new) or, even better, fix it.

Read on to learn more about submitting changes.


## Feature requests

If you think a feature is missing, please [make a suggestion](https://github.com/sagikazarmark/helm-charts/issues/new) or, even better, implement it.

If you do report it, please describe your use case concretely and with as much details as possible.
Hiding details behind abstractions makes it harder to understand the problem.

If you decide to take a stab at implementing the feature,
read the rest of this guide to learn more about submitting changes.


## Opening a pull request

The project accepts changes in the form of pull requests (or PRs).
Pull requests allow maintainers to properly review the patch before accepting it
and lets the continuous integration (CI) system, in this case [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions), run automated checks to make sure the proposed change doesn't break anything.

If you are new to GitHub or the concept of pull requests, check out the [official GitHub documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).


### Prerequisites

First of all, you are going to need [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) in order to test your changes.
You can find the currently used version in the [.tool-versions](https://github.com/sagikazarmark/helm-charts/blob/master/.tool-versions) file at the root of this repository.

Alternatively, you can use [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/) to install the right version.

You will also need a Kubernetes cluster to test your changes.
One option is using [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) and installing the updated chart in a local cluster.
An alternative is using a managed Kubernetes provider, like [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/).


### Forking the repository

Fork the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/sagikazarmark/helm-charts) by clicking on the _Fork_ button in the right upper corner and clone the repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/helm-charts.git
cd helm-charts
git remote add upstream https://github.com/sagikazarmark/helm-charts.git
git fetch upstream
```

### Making changes

You are ready to make changes to a chart.

Start by creating a new branch:

```bash
git checkout -b my-branch -t upstream/master
```

Each pull request should contain changes for a single chart, unless it's a systematic change affecting all or multiple charts.

If you would like to submit breaking changes, please open an issue/discussion first to discuss them with the maintainers.


#### Adding variables to `values.yaml`

Changes often involve adding new variables to `values.yaml`.
If that is the case, please follow the documentation pattern found in `values.yaml` files:

```yaml
# -- This line documents some variable.
# Optional line to link to API references or other places that describe this variable in more detail.
someVariable: 12
```

Variables often enable/disable certain features based on a default nil value.
In that case the variable should still be added to the `values.yaml` file so that it can appear in the generated documentation:

```yaml
# -- (int) This variable has a default nil.
# Notice the variable type above: it hints the documentation generator to use the correct type.
someOtherVariable:
```

For additional `values.yaml` best practices check out the [official Helm documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_best_practices/values/).


### Testing

Once you are ready with your changes, make sure they pass the linter:

```bash
helm lint charts/CHART
```

Next, you should install the chart in a Kubernetes cluster to make sure your changes don't break existing functionality:

> **Pro tip:** Create a `values.test.yaml` in the chart directory (don't worry about accidentally committing it: it is in gitignore).

```bash
helm upgrade --install -f charts/CHART/values.test.yaml my-chart-test charts/CHART
```

Delete the release from the cluster once you made sure that your changes work:

```bash
helm delete my-chart-test
```

For smaller changes (or before installing the chart on a cluster) it might be enough to compile the templates:

```bash
helm template -f charts/CHART/values.test.yaml my-chart-test charts/CHART
```

Repeat the test with your feature disabled to make sure the default happy path isn't broken either.


### Committing the changes

Try to keep your changes grouped logically within individual commits.
It's easier for maintainers to review changes that way.

Once you are done with your changes and testing, commit your changes:

```bash
git add charts/CHART/
git commit -m 'feat(charts/CHART): add feature X'
```


#### Commit message guidelines

A good commit message should describe what changed and why.
This project uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) to structure commit messages.
In the future, commit messages might help automating the release process (eg. automatic chart version bumps).

Examples of commit messages following Conventional Commits:

- `fix(charts/CHART): chart repo url points to the right location`
- `feat(charts/CHART): add external secret`
- `docs(charts/CHART): add note about private GKE clusters`

Note the added `charts/CHART` context in the commit message: it signals which chart is affected.

Please look at the [Conventional Commits site](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for more examples and details.


### Documenting changes

If you made changes to the documentation template (`README.md.gotmpl`) or `values.yaml`,
you need to regenerate the documentation:

```bash
make docs
git commit -m 'docs(charts/CHART): regenerate documentation'
```

You can also bundle the documentation changes with your other commits to make the commit history nicer.


### Updating `Chart.yaml`

After all changes are done, you need to update the `Chart.yaml` file in the chart.


#### Adding change log

Changes documented under the `artifacthub.io/changes` annotation appear automatically on [Artifact Hub](https://artifacthub.io/).

The annotation value for each version (and as a result each PR) should be cleared before adding new entries.

Here is an example for a change log:

```yaml
annotations:
  artifacthub.io/changes: |
    - kind: added
      description: Awesome feature that will let you do X
      links: # Optional
        - name: Github PR
          url: https://github.com/.../.../pull/1234
```

The kind can be one of the following:

- added
- changed
- deprecated
- removed
- fixed
- security

The description should be brief, but explain the change in as much detail as possible.
If needed, you can add links to the GitHub PR or other related resources to add more detail.


#### Bumping chart version

Every merged change automatically gets released with the version found in `Chart.yaml`.
As a result, every PR needs to bump the version in that file.
Failing to do that results in CI failure.

We follow [SemVer](https://semver.org/), so you should bump the version according to its guidelines,
but here is a couple of examples to make the decision easier:

- Minor documentation and feature changes/fixes should result in a **patch** version bump
- New features should result in a **minor** version bump
- Significant, but backward compatible changes should result in a **minor** version bump
- Breaking changes should result in a **major** version bump

After bumping the version regenerate the documentation:

```bash
# bump chart version
make docs
git commit -m 'chore(charts/CHART): bump chart version'
```


### Opening the pull request

Once you are done with all changes, push your branch to GitHub:

```bash
git push -u origin my-branch
```

Then click on the pull request link appearing in the terminal or go to your fork and
open a pull request from your branch.

Fill out the pull request template and hit submit.

Wait for someone to review your changes.
Please don't start pinging maintainers if noone reacts in a couple days:
we are all busy with our life.

Once your changes are reviewed the pull request either get merged
or the reviewer requests some changes. We try to minimize the number of review rounds,
but please don't get offended if you need to update your pull request multiple times.

Congratulations on the contribution and thanks! üéâüëç
